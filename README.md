A simple PDF merger. Your PDFs are NOT uploaded during the process, so it's completely safe, fast, and extremely lightweight.
The tool uses the awesome, open source
- [pdf-lib](https://pdf-lib.js.org/) from [Hopding](https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib) for manipulating the PDFs,
- [pdf-js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) from Mozilla for generating the thumbnails of the PDF
